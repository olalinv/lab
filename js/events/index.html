      <h2>DOMContentLoaded</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
      </p>
      <h2>load</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>load</code> event is fired when a resource and its dependent resources have finished loading.
      </p>
      <h2>beforeunload</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>beforeunload</code> event is fired when the window, the document and its resources are about to be unloaded. The document is still visible and the event is still cancelable at this point.
      </p>
      <h2>unload</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>unload</code> event is fired when the document or a child resource is being unloaded.
